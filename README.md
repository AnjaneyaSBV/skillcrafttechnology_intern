## 📌 Tasks Overview

### 🔥 Task 01 – Temperature Converter

A program that converts temperatures between **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin** scales.

**Features:**

* Converts from any scale to the other two.
* Simple menu-driven interface.

---

### 🎲 Task 02 – Number Guessing Game

A fun game where the computer generates a **random number** and the user has to guess it.

**Features:**

* Random number between 1–100.
* Hints: *Too High* / *Too Low*.
* Tracks number of attempts.

---

### 🧩 Task 03 – Sudoku Solver

A program that **solves Sudoku puzzles** automatically using the **backtracking algorithm**.

**Features:**

* Accepts a partially filled Sudoku grid (0 = empty).
* Fills missing numbers to solve the puzzle.
* Prints the solved board.

---

### 🛒 Task 04 – Web Scraper (E-commerce Products)

A web scraping program that extracts product data (name, price, rating) from an e-commerce site and stores it in a CSV file.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-practice-projects.git
cd python-practice-projects
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the Programs

Each task has its own Python file:

```bash
python task01_temperature_converter.py
python task02_guessing_game.py
python task03_sudoku_solver.py
python task04_web_scraper.py
```

In **Google Colab**, copy-paste the code blocks from each file into a cell and run.
